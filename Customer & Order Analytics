#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
